This program will perform some arithmetic operations when given two numbers using functions

Step 1: Prompt user to enter two numbers 
Step 2: Define function that adds the numbers and return sum
Step 3: Define function that multiplies the two numbers and return product
Step 4: Define function that divides first number by second number and return quotient
Step 5: Define function that takes two numbers, subtracts second from first and return difference
Step 6: Define function that find reminder of first number divided by second number
Step 7: Define function that find the first to the power of the second number and returns the value
Step 8: Define a function that takes a number and returns the square-root of the number. 
Step 9: Call all functions and display answers with descriptions 
Step 10: Write a test function that to automatically test each function
Bonus step: Write function that finds the larger of the two numbers
