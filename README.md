# Assignments 
## 1- Std IO 
- Program does print the stages of the Hangman Game
- I have met the requirements for this assignment
- I have also ran the program multiple times and it has worked. 
- I deserve attleast 90% grade for the code work. I'm sure that I did this last self-evaluation step right, so if that is the case, then I deserve 100%. 

## 2- Triangle
- Program does find the area and perimeter of a triangle given three sides
- All requirements are completed
- Program has been tested many times and good success 
- grade 100/100 because I had to lookup help for the last part (verifying if three sides given are indeed a triangle). I honestly just wanted to see how it works and I was curious about the "if, else" function. Up to you if you want to give me the extra points. I did the rest on my own though. 

## 3 - Functions
- Program does do the arithmetic functions stated 
- All requirements are met and completed 
- Program has been tested many times 
- Grade 110/100 because I met all the requirements outlined and I tested the program multiple times using the calculator from Anaconda to verify that the math is correct. I also completed the bonus step and the test cases are all working properly as well. 
- Here is the screenshot

## 4 - Conditionals 
- Program does find the sum, product, average, maximum and minimum
-All requirements are met and completed 
-Program has been tested many times 
-Grade 105/100 because I met all the requirements and I did the bonus step as well. I did have to get help from the internet on 
the max function. 

## 5 - Loop Project
- Program plays the Guess the Number Game without the stats 
- All requirements are met and completed 
- Program has been tested mulitple times 
- Grade 105/100, because I met all the requirements. I figured out half of the bonus step where the game can keep going as long 
as the player wants. I couldn't figure out the stats after the player quits. I will try to figure it out later (obviously not for the grade) 

## Falling Apart Problem
- Program has been accepted by kattis
- https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98496814/165140484-becaa81a-34c7-423e-88e7-de69d553dbf5.png
- wrote three test cases and they passed
- readme is up to date
- Grade: 90/100 because the solution was accepted and the screenshot is above. Test cases should work since it returns "All test cases passed" but there could be a bug.
