# Assignments 
## 1- Std IO 
- Program does print the stages of the Hangman Game
- I have met the requirements for this assignment
- I have also ran the program multiple times and it has worked. 
- I deserve attleast 90% grade for the code work. I'm sure that I did this last self-evaluation step right, so if that is the case, then I deserve 100%. 

## 2- Triangle
- Program does find the area and perimeter of a triangle given three sides
- All requirements are completed
- Program has been tested many times and good success 
- grade 100/100 because I had to lookup help for the last part (verifying if three sides given are indeed a triangle). I honestly just wanted to see how it works and I was curious about the "if, else" function. Up to you if you want to give me the extra points. I did the rest on my own though. 

##3 - Functions
- Program does do the arithmetic functions stated 
- All requirements are met and completed 
- Program has been tested many times 
- Grade 110/100 because I met all the requirements outlined and I tested the program multiple times using the calculator from Anaconda to verify that the math is correct. I also completed the bonus step and the test cases are all working properly as well.
